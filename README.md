It is a fantasy minigame with one hero and three monster characters, with health bar and "dice". 
When we click the attack button then the dices generate random numbers, these numbers are the power of the attack.
The characters attack each other and according to their power of attack their health will decrease. 
This decrease is represented proportionally on the health bar.

There are 3 monsters, when one of them dies the next one is coming. Each monster has different health and attack power.
The game is ended when the wizard or all of the monsters are dead.
